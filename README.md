# hello-world

Hi Everyone,

I'm in the market for a new job, but this has lead me to rethink what I want from life!

Now I catch up with GitHub some 2 months later.  I have a job, which is going very well, but the whole experience has left me with a different outlook on life.  My children and family are the most important things to me!!
